<h2>About PetPals NC</h2>
<ul class='list'>
<li>In 2007, Wendy Stewart, a licensed clinical social worker, who worked as a school social worker for Orange County Schools, researched pet-assisted therapy as a possible way to better reach students in a non-traditional high school.</li>
<li>She became certified as a Team with Ella, a rescued mix, followed by Julius and Foster. All three therapy dogs rotated days, working with students in both of Wendy’s assigned schools.</li>
<li>As word spread about the good things that were happening with the dogs, other schools requested therapy dogs, and in 2010, Wendy established “Pet Pals” as a program and began to recruit other therapy Teams from the community to place in those schools.</li>
<li>Wendy retired in 2014 from the school district and set to work to grow the program.</li>
<li>PetPalsNC was incorporated and received 501(c)3 status early in 2016.</li>
